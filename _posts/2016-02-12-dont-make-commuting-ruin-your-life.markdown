title: "Don't Make Commuting Ruin Your Life"

Commuting to work is something inevitable for me. I've been spending nearly three hours a day on my way between home and work. It is almost one fifth of my awake life. Or in other words 40 days in a year. That's a lot of time to waste.

Aside from reading books and playing games on my phone, I listen to podcasts and watch YouTube videos while commuting to work. In this post I like to share the **podcasts** I listen and how I watch **YouTube videos offline** (in the subway).
	

# Podcasts I Like
I am using [Pocketcast](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts) android app to listen to podcast. Itâ€™s a feature-rich, powerful app that makes subscribing to podcasts and setting up automatic downloads a snap. It also syncs across devices and platforms (IOS, Android and web), making it ideal if you move between an Android phone and an iPad.

List of Podcasts I like to listen:

# Download Youtube Videos And Watch Them Offline

In the subway I usually watch YouTube videos. Since YouTube does not have an offline video support I have to download videos and copy them to my phone or tablet. There are applications to download YouTube content but as a programmer I prefer [this python library](https://github.com/mps-youtube/pafy) to download YouTube content and retrieve metadata. 

You can install [Pafy](https://github.com/mps-youtube/pafy) with [pip installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
{% highlight python %}
sudo pip install pafy
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a simple shell script to download YouTube videos by their urls. Save this file as **youtube_download.py**.

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import pafy

url = sys.argv[1]
video = pafy.new(url)
best = video.getbest()
best.download(quiet=False)
{% endhighlight %}

For example to download this inspiring talk from [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) just type:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FS1mnISoG7U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{% highlight python %}
youtube_download.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U
{% endhighlight %}

Hope these tips make your commute bearable!
